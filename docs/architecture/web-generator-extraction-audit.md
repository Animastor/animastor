# Web Generator — Extraction Audit (Re-verification)

**Status:** READ-ONLY audit (no production code changed, no files moved, no packages created)  
**Date:** 2026-09-13  
**Branch:** `c21.4-physically-extract-analysis-from-backend`  
**Baseline commit:** `066ddaae` ("arch(orchestration): physically extract orchestration package")  
**Target package:** `@animastor/web-generator`  
**Target location:** `packages/animastor-web-generator/` (NOT created — no physical extraction performed)  
**Re-verification of:** `web-next-extraction-reconnaissance.md` (§3.1, verdict "NOT READY")  
**Context:** Verdict re-checked at current HEAD after the workers (`b096d2a6`) and local-ai (`71065221`) extractions.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Generator contour is **NOT READY** for physical package extraction at current HEAD. The verdict from the previous reconnaissance is **unchanged**, but the risk surface has shifted: the generateStore⇄playbackStore cycle is dissolved, the store has no router or `@animastor/*` dependencies, and API access is a pure transport layer. What remains is the **identity blocker**: `generateStore` is the host-owned source of truth for session identity (`bookId`/`buildId`), written and read by 10+ host files, 3 extracted packages (via adapters), auth stash/restore, and the fileStore session seam.

A **domain-first slice** (analysis/progress pure logic) is READY WITH CONDITIONS and is the recommended first safe contour.

**Key findings:**
- **2,553 LOC** core contour (4 files), ~30 signals in one store
- **10 direct production consumers** + fileStore via injected seams
- **No `@animastor/*` imports** — pure host modules today
- **No web-facing generation contracts** in `@animastor/contracts` — wire types would need vendoring (precedent: `animastor-web-player/src/models.ts`)
- Cycle generateStore⇄playbackStore **already dissolved** (guard-pinned in `player-contour.guard.test.ts`)

## 3. Dependency Matrix

### 3.1 Generator → host

| Dependency | Nature | Port/Adapter candidate |
|---|---|---|
| `@preact/signals` (signal) | external lib | direct dep of a future package (like web-player) |
| `api/client` (`getJson/postJson/postJsonLong/putJson/sse`) | domain (transport) | **http port** (precedent: `PlayerHttpPort`, `WorkerPorts.api`) |
| `api/models` (generation wire types) | domain (wire contract) | **vendor into package models.ts** (precedent: web-player/models.ts) |
| `positionStore` (`navigateTo`, `position`) | host state | **position port** (precedent: `PlayerPositionPort` write direction) |
| `app/i18n` (`vbookStageLabel`) | UI localization | **i18n port** (typed key union, precedent: `PlayerI18nPort`) |
| `router` (`navigate`) | host navigation | **navigation port** (precedent: `FilePorts.navigation`) |
| `routeState` (`workerType` write) | host route coupling | navigation port payload or routeState adapter |
| `desktop` (`useDesktopShell`) | host shell | **shellMode port** (precedent: `PlayerShellModePort`) |
| `icons` (10 icons) | UI | **icons port** (precedent: `PlayerIconsPort`) |
| `lib/ui` (`toast`, etc.) | UI | **ui port** (precedent: `WorkerPorts.ui`) |
| `resourceInvalidations` (`bookResource`, `onResourceInvalidated`) | host event bus | **invalidations port** (precedent: `PlayerInvalidationsPort`) |
| `resilientReloader` | transport resilience | http port (fold `retryWithBackoff` semantics) |
| `document`/`window` (GeneratePage dialog only) | host DOM | stays in page component / ui port |

### 3.2 Host → Generator (reverse — the blocker cluster)

| Consumer | Symbols consumed | Why it can't move yet |
|---|---|---|
| `app/AppShell.tsx` | `generationStatus`, `bookId`, `phase`, `blankBookJustCreated` | nav pulse class, desktop `/file`+`/navigate` bounce-to-`/play`/`/generate` decision |
| `app/fileAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `phase`, `errorMessage`, `dirtySummary`, `blankBookJustCreated`, `loadBook`, `emitPlaybackPrepared`, `resetProgressState`, `clearVBookProgress`, `setRegenerating`, `bumpVBookPollToken`, `markImportIncomplete`, `stopGenerationSession` | the FilePorts composition seam — session identity **by reference** |
| `app/playerAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | `PlayerPorts.session` + `PlayerPorts.generation` |
| `app/navigatorAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | `NavigatorPorts.bookSource` |
| `pages/EditPage.tsx` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `dirtySummary`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | dirty indicator + generation-completion soft refresh |
| `pages/SettingsPage.tsx` | `bookId`, `resetProgressState` | clear-cache flow |
| `pages/AiAssistantPage.tsx` | `bookId` | book-scoped AI context |
| `main.tsx` | `bookId` | login-triggered `restoreBookSession()` re-entry |
| `state/authStore.ts` | `stashBookSessionForUser`, `restoreStashedBookSessionForUser` | logout/login book-session isolation (**hard auth→identity edge**) |
| `state/fileStore.ts` | no direct import — via injected `SessionSeam`/`GenerationResetSeam`/`PlaybackPreparedSeam`/`PlayerSeam` | `phase`/`errorMessage` dual-writer contract (audit B6) |

Test consumers: `state/__tests__/auth-book-session.test.ts`, `state/fileStore.test.ts`, `app/fileAdapters.test.ts`, both relevant architecture guards.

### 3.3 Generator → existing packages

**None.** Zero `@animastor/*` imports in the contour (grep-verified). The dependency direction is inverted: three extracted packages (web-player, web-editor, web-navigator) consume generator identity/events **through their host adapters**.

### 3.4 Possible cycles

- Historical cycle generateStore⇄playbackStore: **dissolved** — no playbackStore import; guard-pinned (`player-contour.guard.test.ts` forbids `state/generateStore.ts → state/playbackStore.ts` edge). Player release now flows through the fileStore `player` seam.
- Remaining potential cycle if extracted naively: `web-generator ⇄ web-player` via `onPlaybackPrepared` (Generator is the **producer**, Player is the consumer). Extraction must keep the event behind a port (Player already consumes it via `PlayerPorts.generation` — the surviving seam is compatible).

### 3.5 Domain dependency vs Ports/Adapters

| Edge | Classification |
|---|---|
| http transport (client.ts) + wire models | **Ports** (transport seam, like every extracted package) |
| i18n/icons/ui/shellMode/navigation | **Ports** (pure presentation host services) |
| `positionStore.navigateTo` | **Port** (write direction; position is host state) |
| invalidations subscription | **Port** (listen direction) |
| `bookId`/`buildId`/`loadBook`/stash/restore | **NOT portable** — host identity ownership (must stay host-side) |
| `phase`/`errorMessage` | **NOT portable as-is** — dual-writer with fileStore; single source of truth must not fork |
| `onPlaybackPrepared` emission | **Port-able** (emit direction), but consumers (Player/Navigator/Edit) must keep subscribing via adapters — dependency inversion is the risk |
| auth stash/restore | **NOT portable** — authStore→generateStore hard edge; extraction would invert it |

---

## 4. Deep-dive: Can the contour be split?

### 4.1 Pure generation domain logic — YES

Extractable pure/near-pure functions inside `generateStore.ts`:
- `applyAnalysisEvent` (+ `analysisOverallPercent`, `resetAnalysisProgress`) — already unit-tested (318 LOC)
- `computeProgressRows` + SSE event routing
- Timer math (`getTimerStartedAt`, `getFinalElapsedSeconds`, `formatTimerText`, `liveElapsedSeconds`, `globalElapsedSeconds` in GeneratePage)

**Condition:** the module-level Maps (`taskReadyFloor`, `taskCompletedAt`, `taskFrozenElapsed`) and latch gates (`generationCompleted`, `newGenerationPending`, `importCompleteReceived`) must be **parameterized into a state object** instead of module scope.

### 4.2 Domain/service layer first, store host-owned — YES (recommended path)

Split `generateStore.ts`:
- **Host keeps:** identity signals (`bookId`, `buildId`), `loadBook`, persistence + per-user stash/restore, `phase`/`errorMessage` (SessionSeam contract), `onPlaybackPrepared` bus
- **Package gets:** VBook flow (startVBookGeneration, polling, agent-status), progress panel (rows/timers), SSE stream machinery, analysis progress state, layer-config/assets-state fetching, regenerate/cancel actions — all parameterized by a `GenerationSession` handle + ports

Precedent: the fileStore B1 split (seams `GenerationResetSeam`/`PlaybackPreparedSeam`/`PlayerSeam`/`SessionSeam` wired in `app/fileAdapters.ts`).

### 4.3 Split Generator into 2+ package contours — YES, naturally

1. **`generation-progress` (analysis/progress domain):** `applyAnalysisEvent`, `analysisOverallPercent`, `computeProgressRows`, SSE routing, wire models (`ProgressEvent`, `ProgressPanelResponse`, `AgentStatusResponse`, `AnalysisTaskRow`) — ~400–500 LOC, zero identity/auth/playback-write. **READY WITH CONDITIONS.**
2. **`generation-orchestration` (VBook/bootstrap flow):** start/bootstrap/cancel/poll actions — depends on identity port + http port. Requires the 4.2 split first.
3. **UI (`GeneratePage` + `AnalysisProgressPanel`):** separable from orchestration (imports only signals + ports), but low value until the store split lands.

### 4.4 State/identity duties that MUST stay host-owned

- `bookId`/`buildId` signals + `loadBook` + localStorage persistence (`animastor:currentBook`)
- Per-user stash/restore (`animastor:currentBook:user:<uid>`) + the authStore edge
- `phase`/`errorMessage` (fileStore dual-writer contract, audit B6)
- `onPlaybackPrepared` bus (Player/Navigator/Edit subscribe host-side via adapters)
- `dirtySummary`/`blankBookJustCreated` (file/editor coordination)

### 4.5 UI separate from generation orchestration — YES (mechanically)

`GeneratePage.tsx` imports only signals, ports-able host services (i18n/router/desktop/icons/ui), and analysis panel. It has 4 poll/timer effects (5s worker counts, 1.5s progress panel, 500ms timer tick, 2.5s restore delay) which belong to orchestration — these should move behind a `GenerationController` port if UI is extracted. Desktop/mobile fork stays via shellMode port (web-player precedent).

### 4.6 Event-bus dependencies the package actually needs

Only **one**: `onPlaybackPrepared` (emit direction). Player's subscription already arrives via `PlayerPorts.generation` — no direct coupling. `resourceInvalidations` subscription (listen) for external AI-patch reload in GeneratePage. Both fit a `GeneratorEvents` port group.

## 5. Comparison with extracted packages

| Dimension | web-player (extracted) | web-workers (extracted) | web-local-ai (extracted) | **Generator** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOC | ~2,000+ | 3,739 | — | 2,553 |
| Own store ownership | no (host playbackStore dissolved into pkg) | yes (self-contained) | yes | **host identity blocker** |
| Session identity (`bookId`/`buildId`) | consumes via ports (by reference) | none | none | **OWNS it** |
| Auth edge | via ports | AuthPort | via ports | **authStore→generateStore hard edge** |
| Consumers | 6 pinned | 1 (SettingsPage) | 2 | **10 direct + seams + 3 packages** |
| Wire contracts vendored | yes (models.ts) | yes | yes | **none exist yet — must vendor** |
| Event bus | consumes `onPlaybackPrepared` | none | none | **produces it** |
| Cycles | resolved (B1 split) | none | none | resolved with player; **new inversion risk if naive** |

**Status NOT READY is confirmed at current HEAD.** The extractions since the last recon (workers, local-ai, editor, ai-chat/settings, orchestration) did not touch the identity/auth/phase cluster — those blockers are structural.

---

## 6. Verdict

**NOT READY** (for full physical extraction of `@animastor/web-generator` as a single unit).  
**READY WITH CONDITIONS** for a domain-first slice (§4.3.1).

### Blockers (exact)

1. **Identity ownership:** `bookId`/`buildId`/`loadBook`/persistence/stash-restore consumed by 10 host files + 3 package adapters; moving them inverts package→host dependency direction.
2. **Auth edge:** `authStore.ts` imports `stashBookSessionForUser`/`restoreStashedBookSessionForUser` — package cannot own logout/login session isolation.
3. **Dual-writer phase/errorMessage:** fileStore SessionSeam + generateStore both write; source of truth must not fork across package boundary.
4. **Event producer inversion:** `onPlaybackPrepared` consumed by Player/Navigator/Edit via adapters — moving the producer inverts the direction unless the bus stays host-side.
5. **No web generation contracts:** wire types live only in host `api/models.ts`; nothing in `@animastor/contracts`.
6. **Module-level state:** timers/Maps/latches in module scope prevent pure-function extraction without parameterization.

### Minimal preparation sequence

1. **Step 1 (safe first contour):** extract generation-progress domain (analysis events, progress rows, SSE routing, timer math) with parameterized state + vendored wire models → package or in-repo module + unit tests moved with it.
2. **Step 2:** split generateStore — identity half stays host (§4.4), orchestration half becomes `GenerationService` parameterized by `GenerationSession` + `GeneratorPorts`.
3. **Step 3:** define `GeneratorPorts` (http+sse, navigateTo, emitPlaybackPrepared, i18n stage labels, invalidations) following `PlayerPorts`/`FilePorts` shape; single `app/generatorAdapters.ts` seam.
4. **Step 4:** add `generator-contour.guard.test.ts` (pinned consumers, entry-only imports, no reverse state deps — same mechanics as the 3 existing guards).
5. **Step 5:** only then, physical extraction of the orchestration+UI package; identity remains host-owned permanently (or until a `@animastor/session` design exists).

## 7. Comparison: Generator vs Workflows vs Admin (current HEAD)

| Candidate | LOC | Store | Host coupling | Coupling risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Generator** | 2,553 | 1 store, ~30 signals | identity + auth + phase dual-write + event producer | **high** (structural) | **NOT READY** (domain slice: READY WITH CONDITIONS) |
| **Workflows** | ~900 (4 pages: 76+156+508+156) | **no store** (useState/useRef only) | `routeState` signals (`detailsEditMode`, `devConnector`), `titleStore`, api, ui, i18n, router | low | **READY WITH CONDITIONS** |
| **Admin** | 490 (365 page + 125 pure systemAi) | **no store** (authMe subscription) | `authStore` only (needs AuthPort — precedent: web-workers) | low | **READY WITH CONDITIONS** |

Notes:
- **Workflows:** zero generateStore usage, zero bookId/buildId, zero playback coupling; backend-only connector APIs. The two routeState signals are the only cross-page state — manageable via a small ports/navigation contract. Largest LOC win at lowest risk.
- **Admin:** smallest; `features/admin/systemAi.ts` is a pure module (no imports); AdminPage needs an AuthPort (already proven in web-workers). No i18n usage (hardcoded English — internal admin).
- **Generator:** biggest and most valuable long-term, but blocked on identity design.

### Recommendation

**Physically extract `@animastor/web-workflows` next** (biggest safe LOC win, standard Ports/Adapters, no identity coupling). **Admin** as the fast follow (AuthPort precedent exists). **Generator:** start Step 1 now (domain-first slice — analysis/progress logic), full extraction deferred until the identity split (§6, Step 2–3) lands.

---

## 8. Guard pattern reference (for the future extraction)

Follow `frontends/app/src/architecture/*.guard.test.ts` mechanics: raw-source scan via `import.meta.glob(..., { query: '?raw', eager: true })`, `importSpecifiers()` regex extraction; checks: physical structure (old paths gone), entry-only consumption (deep-specifier ban), pinned consumer allowlist, single adapters file building Ports, reverse-dep bans (no state/ module imports the package; no state cycles), identity ownership (no host file binds bookId/buildId from package entry; fileStore must not re-declare identity signals), pinned route mounts in main.tsx, test-mock discipline (entry, not deep paths).
